# form-page
application so that the user can make appointment scheduling requests.
for that I used html5, also using css3 styling for the elements. I put options in the selection of schedules and medical specialties. when I made this little project I used figma as a base to create this page as a form. Inside the form element, there is a textarea for additional comments and also
the user, will have a button with the id submit to send the information..
